# 📺 Netflix Data Cleaning & Processing Project

## 📌 Overview

This project simulates a real-world data wrangling workflow using a custom-built Netflix-style dataset full of inconsistencies, missing values, and redundancies.

### 🚀 Goals
- Practice data cleaning on a messy, real-life-style dataset
- Apply pandas-based processing to prepare data for visualization and analysis
- Showcase data engineering techniques as part of a portfolio

## 🔧 Dataset Description

- **Original Dataset:** `netflix_realistic_dirty_dataset.csv`
- **Processed Output:** `netflix_processed_data.csv`
- Simulated issues include:
  - Duplicates
  - Inconsistent date and duration formats
  - Misspelled country and rating fields
  - Missing values in key columns

---

## 🧼 Phase 1: Data Cleaning

✔ Remove duplicates  
✔ Handle missing values  
✔ Normalize date and duration formats  
✔ Correct typos (e.g., "Untied States" → "United States")  
✔ Split `cast` and `listed_in` into lists

---

## 🛠️ Phase 2: Data Processing

✔ Extract `duration_minutes`, `cast_count`  
✔ Extract `year_added`, `month_added`  
✔ One-hot encode genres  
✔ Group data for summaries (e.g., by country)
